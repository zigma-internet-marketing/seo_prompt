# Validation Notes – Final Content Readiness Review

This document is used after linting and enforcement checks pass.
Its purpose is to validate whether the content is genuinely usable,
credible, and aligned with intent before publishing.

--------------------------------------------------
1. HUMAN READABILITY CHECK
--------------------------------------------------

- Does the content sound like a knowledgeable person explaining a real situation?
- Would a subject-matter expert find this accurate and grounded?
- Does any paragraph feel like it exists only to fill space?

If yes → rewrite with a concrete scenario or consequence.

--------------------------------------------------
2. INTENT SATISFACTION CHECK
--------------------------------------------------

Confirm the reader’s intent is clearly satisfied:

- Informational:
  - Is the topic clearly explained?
  - Are unknowns reduced by the end?

- Commercial:
  - Are options compared fairly?
  - Are trade-offs explained honestly?

- Transactional:
  - Are steps and expectations clear?
  - Is the next action obvious but not pushy?

- Navigational:
  - Does the content confirm the reader is in the right place?
  - Is reassurance provided?

--------------------------------------------------
3. DECISION SUPPORT CHECK
--------------------------------------------------

Ask:
- Could a reader make a better decision after reading this?
- Are risks, limitations, or constraints acknowledged?
- Is at least one comparison or alternative presented when relevant?

If the answer is “no” → content is incomplete.

--------------------------------------------------
4. TRUST & CREDIBILITY CHECK
--------------------------------------------------

- Are claims specific and believable?
- Are timelines, costs, or outcomes realistic?
- Are authority signals earned (experience, examples) rather than asserted?

Avoid:
- exaggerated certainty
- unnamed “experts”
- vague proof

--------------------------------------------------
5. LOCAL & CONTEXTUAL ACCURACY
--------------------------------------------------

If a target location is used:
- Does it feel natural and relevant?
- Is it used sparingly and accurately?
- Are local conditions actually connected to the topic?

If location feels decorative → remove or re-anchor.

--------------------------------------------------
6. CTA APPROPRIATENESS CHECK
--------------------------------------------------

- Do CTAs match the intent and content type?
- Are they phrased as options, not pressure?
- Do they feel earned by the content?

If a CTA feels abrupt → soften or reposition.

--------------------------------------------------
7. OVERALL SANITY TEST
--------------------------------------------------

Before approving, ask:

- Would I trust this content if I found it on a competitor’s site?
- Would I bookmark or share it if I were the target reader?
- Does it feel written *for people*, not *for algorithms*?

If hesitation exists → revise the weakest section first.

--------------------------------------------------
8. FINAL COMPLIANCE QUICK-CHECK (BEFORE PUBLISHING)
--------------------------------------------------

- Output_format compliance:
  - text mode: zero HTML tags
  - html mode: semantic tags only (no document shell tags)

- CTA compliance:
  - blog: max 1 soft CTA near end
  - page: CTAs feel earned, not repetitive, not pushy

- Pricing compliance:
  - No numbers unless pricing was explicitly provided in inputs

- Location realism (if location is present):
  - Must be context-linked (not decorative)
  - No invented local claims
